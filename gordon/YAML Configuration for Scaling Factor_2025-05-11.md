Yes, it appears that the `MultiplicationAdapterStrategyConfig` can be configured using a YAML file. Based on the search results, the file `gordon/adapter_cfg.yaml` contains an example configuration that sets the `scaling_factor`:

```yaml
adapter_strategy:
  _target_: new_nemo_adaptive.MultiplicationAdapterStrategy
  scaling_factor: 1.0
```

This indicates that you can set the `scaling_factor` for `MultiplicationAdapterStrategyConfig` within a YAML configuration file under the `adapter_strategy` key.

---

_**User**_

True. But where is the link with these settings established? Where is MultiplicationAdapterStrategy instanitated?

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Okay, let's investigate further. The YAML configuration snippet you found uses the `_target_` field, which is a common pattern (often used with libraries like OmegaConf or Hydra) to specify the class path for instantiation. In your case, `_target_: new_nemo_adaptive.MultiplicationAdapterStrategy` tells the configuration system to instantiate the `MultiplicationAdapterStrategy` class from the `new_nemo_adaptive` module.

Based on the previous search results, the `MultiplicativeAdapterConfig` dataclass includes a field for `adapter_strategy` of type `MultiplicationAdapterStrategyConfig`. The `MultiplicativeAdapter` class then takes an `adapter_strategy` argument in its `__init__` and uses a method like `setup_adapter_strategy`.

This suggests that the `MultiplicationAdapterStrategy` is likely instantiated *indirectly* when a `MultiplicativeAdapter` (or another module that uses this strategy config) is created from a configuration object. The configuration system reads the YAML, resolves the `_target_` for `adapter_strategy` to the `MultiplicationAdapterStrategy` class, and passes the `scaling_factor` value to its `__init__` when creating the strategy instance. This strategy instance is then passed to the adapter module (e.g., `MultiplicativeAdapter`).

To confirm this, we can look for where `MultiplicativeAdapter` (or a similar adapter module) is instantiated, potentially using a config object loaded from a YAML file. We can also examine the `setup_adapter_strategy` method if it's available in the search results or we can read the file containing it.

Let's look for where `MultiplicativeAdapter` is used, focusing on instantiations from config.

Based on the search results, the `MultiplicationAdapterStrategy` is not directly instantiated by code that you'd explicitly write like `MultiplicationAdapterStrategy(scaling_factor=...)`.

Instead, it's instantiated indirectly by a configuration system (likely OmegaConf or Hydra, given the usage of `DictConfig` and `instantiate`) when an adapter module that *uses* `MultiplicationAdapterStrategyConfig` in its own configuration is created.

Here's how the link is established and where the instantiation happens:

1.  **Configuration (`.yaml`):** You define the configuration for the adapter module and its strategy in a YAML file like `adapter_cfg.yaml`. This config specifies the class to be instantiated (`_target_`) for the adapter module (`MultiplicativeAdapter`) and, nested within that, the class and parameters for the adapter strategy (`MultiplicationAdapterStrategyConfig` with `scaling_factor`).

    ```yaml
    _target_: new_nemo_adaptive.MultiplicativeAdapter
    size: 2
    hidden_dim: 64
    num_layers: 3
    adapter_strategy:
      _target_: new_nemo_adaptive.MultiplicationAdapterStrategy
      scaling_factor: 1.0 # <-- Your setting from YAML
    ```

2.  **Loading the Config:** In your Python code, you load this YAML configuration, typically into an OmegaConf `DictConfig`:
    ```python
    adapter_cfg = OmegaConf.load("adapter_cfg.yaml")
    ```

3.  **Adding the Adapter:** You then call an `add_adapter` method on your main model or module that supports adapters (this module likely inherits from `AdapterModuleMixin`).

    ```python
    model.add_adapter("my_multiplicative_adapter", cfg=adapter_cfg)
    ```

4.  **Instantiation via `instantiate`:** The `add_adapter` method (found in `nemo/core/classes/mixins/adapter_mixins.py`) is where the magic happens. It takes the `cfg` (your loaded `adapter_cfg`) and uses a function like `hydra.utils.instantiate` (or a similar mechanism) to create the objects defined in the config.

    Looking at the code for `AdapterModuleMixin.add_adapter` in `nemo/core/classes/mixins/adapter_mixins.py`, you can see the line:

    ```python
    self.adapter_layer[adapter_name] = instantiate(cfg, **kwargs)
    ```
    This `instantiate` call reads the `_target_` from the top level of the `cfg` (`new_nemo_adaptive.MultiplicativeAdapter`) and calls its constructor. When `instantiate` processes the arguments for `MultiplicativeAdapter`, it sees the nested `adapter_strategy` config. It then recursively calls `instantiate` on this nested config, using its `_target_` (`new_nemo_adaptive.MultiplicationAdapterStrategy`) and passing the `scaling_factor` value from the YAML to the `MultiplicationAdapterStrategy.__init__`.

In summary, the `MultiplicationAdapterStrategy` is instantiated by the configuration system (`instantiate`) when the `add_adapter` method is called with a configuration that specifies the `MultiplicativeAdapter` and includes the nested configuration for the `MultiplicationAdapterStrategy` with the desired `scaling_factor`. The `add_adapter` method is the key link where the YAML configuration is used to create the Python objects.

Why would `torch_no_grad` be used in `forward`? 

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Using `torch.no_grad()` within the `forward` method of a PyTorch module is typically done for computations that should *not* have gradients calculated or recorded in the computation graph.

Here are a few reasons why you might see `torch.no_grad()` used inside a `forward` pass:

1.  **Inference or Evaluation:** If a part of the `forward` method is used for tasks like calculating metrics, logging, or making predictions during evaluation (not training), you disable gradient calculation to save memory and computation. While it's more common to wrap the entire evaluation loop with `torch.no_grad()`, specific operations within `forward` that are *only* relevant for inference might use it.

2.  **Fixed or Precomputed Operations:** Some operations within a complex `forward` pass might be fixed, non-trainable transformations or lookups that don't require gradients to flow through them. Wrapping these specific operations in `torch.no_grad()` prevents unnecessary graph building.

3.  **Initialization on First Forward Pass:** In rare cases, some lazy initialization or setup might occur on the very first forward pass. If this initialization shouldn't contribute to the gradient of that first step, `torch.no_grad()` might be used. (Though initialization is usually better placed in `__init__`).

4.  **Auxiliary Computations:** If the `forward` method performs auxiliary computations (like computing statistics, creating visualizations, or assertions) that are not part of the main output requiring gradients, `torch.no_grad()` ensures these don't interfere with the backward pass.

**Important Note:**

For the *main* computation path in a module's `forward` method that is intended for training, you *must not* use `torch.no_grad()`, as this would prevent gradients from being computed for the parameters involved, making training impossible for that part of the network.

Looking at the code snippets from the search, the `MultiplicationAdapterStrategy.forward` method itself does *not* use `torch.no_grad()`. The `torch.no_grad()` context is shown in the `reset_parameters` method (for initialization) and in test cases when calling `forward` for verification purposes, which are standard and expected uses outside of the main trainable forward pass.

The forward method of LightningAdapterModule uses `torch.no_grad`, within which the base model is run. I assume that is because I am only training the adapter? But if the adapter weights are frozen, that should not be an issue. 

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Yes, your assumption is correct. The primary reason for wrapping the base model execution within `torch.no_grad()` inside the `LightningAdapterModule.forward` method when training adapters is precisely because the base model's parameters are typically frozen and should not participate in gradient calculation.

Here's a breakdown:

1.  **Frozen Base Model:** In adapter fine-tuning, the weights of the large pre-trained base model are usually frozen (`param.requires_grad = False`). This is done to keep the base model fixed and train only the much smaller adapter parameters.
2.  **Gradient Calculation:** PyTorch's autograd system builds a computation graph during the forward pass to track operations and their dependencies for the backward pass (gradient calculation).
3.  **Efficiency:** Even if a tensor or module has `requires_grad = False`, operations involving it *can* still be tracked in the graph if they interact with tensors that *do* require gradients. While it might not lead to gradients flowing back to the frozen parameters, building this graph for operations on frozen parts is unnecessary overhead in terms of memory and computation.
4.  **`torch.no_grad()` Purpose:** The `torch.no_grad()` context manager disables gradient tracking entirely within its scope. By calling the `base_model` inside `torch.no_grad()`, you ensure that none of the operations performed by the base model contribute to the computation graph. This significantly reduces the memory footprint and computation time during the forward and backward passes because PyTorch doesn't need to store intermediate values or build graph nodes for the base model.

So, in the context of training adapters where the base model is frozen, using `torch.no_grad()` around the base model call is an optimization to prevent building an unnecessary computation graph for the non-trainable part of the model. The adapter's forward pass, which *is* trainable, would happen *outside* of this `torch.no_grad()` block to allow gradients to be computed for the adapter parameters.

---

_**User**_

But if the base model is frozen, the tensors of the base model are by defition not tracked. There should be no computational cost incurred. 

---

_**Assistant**_



---

That's a great point for clarification, and you're right that if a tensor's `requires_grad` is `False`, gradients will not flow *to* that tensor's parameters during the backward pass. However, the computation graph can still be built for operations involving tensors with `requires_grad = False` if their outputs are subsequently used in operations that *do* require gradients.

Here's a more detailed explanation:

1.  **`tensor.requires_grad = False`:** This flag primarily controls whether gradients are computed *for* the tensor itself (specifically, if the tensor is a leaf node like a model parameter). It means that `tensor.grad` will not be populated during `backward()`.
2.  **Computation Graph Building:** PyTorch's autograd system builds a dynamic computation graph of operations performed during the forward pass. This graph is necessary to compute gradients during the backward pass using the chain rule.
3.  **Operations Involving Frozen Tensors:** Even if `base_model.parameters()` all have `requires_grad = False`, the operations performed by the `base_model` (like matrix multiplications, activations, etc.) still create new tensors. If the output of the base model is then passed to a layer (like an adapter) whose parameters *do* have `requires_grad = True`, PyTorch *might* still record the operations of the base model in the graph up to that point, to understand how the final output (from the adapter) depends on the base model's output. It won't compute gradients for the base model parameters, but the overhead of building and traversing that part of the graph still exists.
4.  **`torch.no_grad()` Context:** The `torch.no_grad()` context manager is a more absolute way to disable gradient tracking. Any operation performed within this context will *not* have its gradient history recorded, regardless of the `requires_grad` status of the input tensors. This means that no computation graph nodes are created for operations inside the `torch.no_grad()` block.

Therefore, even with frozen base model parameters, wrapping the base model call in `torch.no_grad()` provides a clear signal to PyTorch's autograd system to *completely skip* graph building for those operations. This results in:

*   **Reduced Memory Usage:** Intermediate tensors produced by the base model within the `no_grad` context don't need to store information for gradient computation.
*   **Faster Execution:** The overhead of building and managing graph nodes for the base model's operations is eliminated.

So, while the base model being frozen prevents gradients from updating its weights, using `torch.no_grad()` is still beneficial for performance and memory efficiency by preventing the unnecessary construction of the computation graph for the frozen part of the model during the forward pass.

I changed the input_dim to 1, and get the error: 
```
RuntimeError: mat1 and mat2 shapes cannot be multiplied (32x1 and 2x16)
```

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Okay, let's figure out this shape mismatch error. The error `RuntimeError: mat1 and mat2 shapes cannot be multiplied (32x1 and 2x16)` occurs during a matrix multiplication operation.

In PyTorch, a `torch.nn.Linear(in_features, out_features)` layer performs the operation `input @ weight.T + bias`. If your input has shape `(batch_size, in_features)`, and the weight has shape `(out_features, in_features)`, the matrix multiplication is `(batch_size, in_features) @ (in_features, out_features)`, resulting in `(batch_size, out_features)`.

The error `(32x1) and (2x16)` suggests a multiplication of a tensor with shape `(32, 1)` by a tensor with shape `(2, 16)`. For matrix multiplication, the inner dimensions must match (1 must equal 2), which is not the case here.

You mentioned changing `input_dim` to 1. Looking at the `MultiplicativeAdapter` definition we saw earlier:

```python
class MultiplicativeAdapter(torch.nn.Module, AdapterModuleUtil):
    def __init__(
        self,
        size: int, # This is likely what you changed to 1
        hidden_dim: int = 32,
        num_layers: int = 2,
        adapter_strategy: MultiplicationAdapterStrategy = None,
    ):
        super().__init__()
        self.size = size # self.size is now 1
        layers = []
        # First Linear layer
        layers.append(torch.nn.Linear(size, hidden_dim, bias=False)) # torch.nn.Linear(1, 32)
        layers.append(torch.nn.ReLU())
        # ... (potentially more layers with hidden_dim, hidden_dim)
        # Last Linear layer
        layers.append(torch.nn.Linear(hidden_dim, size, bias=False)) # torch.nn.Linear(32, 1)
        layers.append(torch.nn.Sigmoid())
        self.model = torch.nn.Sequential(*layers)
        # ... rest of init
```

If `size` is 1 and `hidden_dim` is 32, the first linear layer is `nn.Linear(1, 32)`. The input to this layer is expected to have its last dimension equal to `in_features`, which is 1. If your input batch `x` has shape `(32, 1)`, the output of the first linear layer will be `(32, 32)`.

This output `(32, 32)` is then passed to the next layer. If `num_layers` is greater than 1, there would be intermediate `nn.Linear(hidden_dim, hidden_dim)` layers, which expect input with the last dimension `hidden_dim` (32). `(32, 32)` matches this.

However, the *last* linear layer is `nn.Linear(hidden_dim, size)`, which is `nn.Linear(32, 1)`. This layer expects an input with the last dimension equal to `hidden_dim` (32). The output from the previous layers (or the first layer if `num_layers` is 1) would have shape `(32, 32)`, which matches the input expectation of this last layer. The output of this last layer would be `(32, 1)`.

The error `(32x1 and 2x16)` doesn't seem to directly correspond to the standard forward pass through these linear layers with an input shape of `(32, 1)`.

Let's re-examine the error message: `mat1 and mat2 shapes cannot be multiplied (32x1 and 2x16)`.

*   `mat1` is `32x1`. This looks exactly like your input batch `x` after you changed `input_dim` to 1, assuming a batch size of 32 (which is common).
*   `mat2` is `2x16`. This shape doesn't match any of the linear layer weights (`(32, 1)` or `(1, 32)` or `(32, 32)`) transposed or otherwise, assuming `hidden_dim` is 32 and `size` is 1.

**Hypothesis:**

The error is not occurring within the `MultiplicativeAdapter` itself, but likely in the *base model* or in the code that *uses* the adapter.

The base model, which you are applying the adapter to, was likely designed to work with an input dimension other than 1 (perhaps 16 or another value hinted at by the `2x16` shape). When you changed `input_dim` to 1, the adapter correctly processes the `(32, 1)` input and outputs something with shape `(32, 1)`, but then this `(32, 1)` output is being fed into a part of the base model that expects a different input shape, leading to the matrix multiplication error.

The `2x16` shape is peculiar. It could be:
*   A transposed weight matrix `(16, 2)` from a layer in the base model.
*   A different tensor entirely.

**To diagnose:**

1.  **Identify where the error occurs:** Get the full traceback. This will show you exactly which line of code is causing the multiplication error and which module it's within.
2.  **Inspect shapes:** At the line where the error occurs, inspect the shapes of the two tensors involved in the multiplication that are causing the mismatch.
3.  **Check Base Model Input:** Verify what input shape the base model (or the specific layer in the base model receiving the adapter's output) is expecting.
4.  **Check Adapter Output:** Confirm the exact shape of the output tensor produced by your `MultiplicativeAdapter` with `size=1`.

Once you have the traceback and the shapes at the point of error, we can pinpoint the exact location and reason for the mismatch. It's highly probable that the base model is receiving an input shape it doesn't expect after you changed the `input_dim` and added the adapter.

_**User**_

@NVIDIA NeMo Does the adapter framework have a class that allows the adapter to apply to x rather than base_model.forward(x)? 

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Based on the documentation, yes, NeMo's adapter framework does support applying adapters directly to the input `x` rather than to `base_model.forward(x)`. This would be implemented through what's called a "Parallel Adapter" in the documentation.

From the "Insertion Form - Module Adapters" section:

> We can also have a `Parallel Adapter` [1] that operates at the input of the module itself, in parallel to the forward pass of the module.

The adapter framework is flexible in terms of insertion points, and the implementation is determined by:

1. The adapter module itself (functional form)
2. The insertion point (where in the network it's applied)
3. The composition strategy (how inputs and outputs are combined)

To create a parallel adapter that applies directly to the input, you would:

1. Create a custom adapter strategy class that extends `AbstractAdapterStrategy`
2. Implement its `forward` method to apply the adapter to the input `x` directly, rather than to the output of the base model
3. When adding the adapter to your model, specify this custom strategy

Your `MultiplicationAdapterStrategy` is actually similar to this approach since it's doing element-wise multiplication with the input rather than adding to an output. The key difference would be when and where it's called in the forward pass of your model.

If you want the adapter to completely bypass the base model, you could create a custom strategy that ignores the base model's output and only returns the adapter's transformation of the input.

_**User**_

I don't want to bypass the base model. I want to be able to modify th ebase model, but be able to apply the adapter to the input of a module rather than its output. Show me how to use the Parallel adapter in Nemo.

Based on the search results, to apply an adapter to the input of a module (rather than its output) in NeMo, you'll need to create a custom adapter strategy. Here's how to implement a parallel adapter approach:

1. Create a custom adapter strategy that processes the input before passing it to the base model
2. Use a module that follows the NeMo adapter pattern in its forward method

Here's a step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Create a custom adapter strategy

Create a custom adapter strategy that applies to the input instead of the output by extending `AbstractAdapterStrategy`:

```python
from nemo.core.classes.mixins import adapter_mixin_strategies
from dataclasses import dataclass

class ParallelInputAdapterStrategy(adapter_mixin_strategies.AbstractAdapterStrategy):
    """
    An adapter strategy that applies the adapter to the input before the base model processes it.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, scaling_factor: float = 1.0):
        super().__init__()
        self.scale = scaling_factor
    
    def forward(self, input: torch.Tensor, adapter: torch.nn.Module, *, module: 'AdapterModuleMixin'):
        """
        Apply the adapter to the input and return the modified input.
        The base model will then process this modified input.
        
        Args:
            input: The original input tensor
            adapter: The adapter module
            module: The parent module
            
        Returns:
            Modified input that will be passed to the base model
        """
        adapter_out = adapter(input)
        # Apply your specific transformation logic here
        # For example: element-wise multiplication as in your MultiplicationAdapterStrategy
        result = self.scale * (input * adapter_out)
        return result

@dataclass
class ParallelInputAdapterStrategyConfig:
    scaling_factor: float = 1.0
    _target_: str = f"{ParallelInputAdapterStrategy.__module__}.{ParallelInputAdapterStrategy.__name__}"
```

### Step 2: Create or modify your module to use this strategy

Update your module's forward method to apply adapters to the input before calling the base model:

```python
class YourModule(torch.nn.Module, adapter_mixins.AdapterModuleMixin):
    def __init__(self, base_model, input_dim):
        super().__init__()
        self.base_model = base_model
        # Initialize other parts of your module
        
    def forward(self, x):
        # Check if adapters are available and enabled
        if self.is_adapter_available():
            # Apply adapters to the input
            x = self.forward_enabled_adapters(x)
            
        # After adapters modify the input, pass to base model
        output = self.base_model(x)
        
        # Any other processing you need to do with the output
        return output
```

### Step 3: Create and add your adapter with the custom strategy

When you add the adapter to your module, specify the custom strategy:

```python
# Create adapter configuration
adapter_cfg = {
    "_target_": "path.to.your.MultiplicativeAdapter", 
    "size": 1,  # Match your input dimension
    "adapter_strategy": {
        "_target_": "path.to.your.ParallelInputAdapterStrategy",
        "scaling_factor": 1.0,
    }
}

# Add adapter to your module
model.add_adapter("input_modifier_adapter", cfg=adapter_cfg)
model.set_enabled_adapters("input_modifier_adapter", enabled=True)
```

### YAML Configuration

You can also define this in your YAML configuration file:

```yaml
_target_: path.to.your.MultiplicativeAdapter
size: 1
hidden_dim: 32
num_layers: 2
adapter_strategy:
  _target_: path.to.your.ParallelInputAdapterStrategy
  scaling_factor: 1.0
```

The key difference from the regular NeMo adapter approach is that your custom adapter strategy is applied to the input before passing it to the base model, rather than modifying the output of the base model. This allows you to preprocess the input with your adapter while still using the base model normally.

---

_**User**_

Of course! Simply add an argument to the forward method. That is trivial since I am calling this forward method in my own adaptor!

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Exactly! That's a much simpler approach. Since you're implementing your own adapter class, you can directly modify its forward method to control exactly how it processes inputs. 

Here's how you could implement it:

```python
class MyParallelAdapter(torch.nn.Module, AdapterModuleUtil):
    """An adapter that can process the input before the base model."""
    
    def __init__(
        self,
        size: int,
        hidden_dim: int = 32,
        num_layers: int = 2,
        scaling_factor: float = 1.0,
    ):
        super().__init__()
        self.size = size
        self.scale = scaling_factor
        
        # Define your adapter layers
        layers = []
        layers.append(torch.nn.Linear(size, hidden_dim, bias=False))
        layers.append(torch.nn.ReLU())
        # ... other layers
        layers.append(torch.nn.Linear(hidden_dim, size, bias=False))
        layers.append(torch.nn.Sigmoid())
        self.model = torch.nn.Sequential(*layers)
        
        # Set up default adapter strategy - this is still needed for NeMo's framework
        self.setup_adapter_strategy(adapter_mixin_strategies.ReturnResultAdapterStrategy())
        
    def forward(self, x):
        """Process the input with the adapter model."""
        adapter_out = self.model(x)
        # Apply your specific transformation
        result = self.scale * (x * adapter_out)
        return result
```

And then in your main module where you use the adapter:

```python
class MyAdaptiveModule(torch.nn.Module, adapter_mixins.AdapterModuleMixin):
    def __init__(self, base_model, input_dim):
        super().__init__()
        self.base_model = base_model
        # Other initialization
        
    def forward(self, x):
        # First apply adapters to modify the input
        if self.is_adapter_available():
            x_modified = self.forward_enabled_adapters(x)
            
        # Then pass the modified input to your base model
        with torch.no_grad():  # Assuming base model is frozen
            output = self.base_model(x_modified)
            
        return output
```

This approach gives you direct control over how your adapter processes inputs, while still working within NeMo's adapter framework. The adapter would modify the input before it's passed to the base model, exactly as you want.

---

_**User**_

what is the error when running @new_nemo_adaptive_parallel.py ? Also look at adapter: @Branch 

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Based on the code you've shared, it looks like the error when running `new_nemo_adaptive_parallel.py` is likely related to a mismatch between your custom `ParallelInputAdapterStrategy` implementation and how it's being called in the adapter framework.

The key issue is in your `ParallelInputAdapterStrategy.forward()` method signature:

```python
def forward(
    self,
    input: torch.Tensor,
    output: torch.Tensor,  # This parameter doesn't exist in standard adapter strategies
    adapter: torch.nn.Module,
    *,
    module: "AdapterModuleMixin",
):
```

Your implementation expects 4 parameters including `output`, but NeMo's adapter framework will only call it with 3 parameters (input, adapter, module). The standard signature should be:

```python
def forward(self, input: torch.Tensor, adapter: torch.nn.Module, *, module: 'AdapterModuleMixin'):
```

Additionally, your adapter configuration in `adapter_cfg.yaml` is pointing to:
```yaml
_target_: new_nemo_adaptive.MultiplicativeAdapter
adapter_strategy:
  _target_: new_nemo_adaptive.MultiplicationAdapterStrategy
```

But your current file defines different classes: `ParallelInputAdapterStrategy` and `SimpleRegressorAdapter`.

To fix this:

1. Update your YAML configuration to match your new class names
2. Modify your strategy's forward method to match the expected signature
3. Make sure `SimpleRegressorAdapter` is properly initialized (the `reset_parameters(self)` call is incorrect)

You'll need to restructure how you're accessing both the input and output in the strategy, perhaps by storing state in the module or adapter rather than passing both in the forward method.

---

_**User**_

Where is the call ot the forward function with 3 parameters? Keep the asnwer short. 

---

_**Assistant**_



---

The call to the strategy's forward method with 3 parameters happens internally in the NeMo framework, specifically in the `forward_single_enabled_adapter_` method of `AdapterModuleMixin`. When you call `self.forward_enabled_adapters(adapter_in)` in your `LightningAdapterModule.forward()` method (line 183), it eventually calls your strategy with only the standard 3 parameters, not the 4 you defined.

The framework expects the strategy's forward method signature to be:
```python
def forward(self, input: torch.Tensor, adapter: torch.nn.Module, *, module: 'AdapterModuleMixin')
```

---

_**User**_

Too much is hidden. I don't see the forward function defined with three parameters. 

---

_**Assistant**_



---

You're right, the forward function with three parameters is not explicitly shown in the code you shared. It's defined in the NeMo framework itself, specifically in `nemo.core.classes.mixins.adapter_mixin_strategies.AbstractAdapterStrategy`. 

When your code calls `self.forward_enabled_adapters(adapter_in)` on line 180, that method (from the NeMo framework) eventually calls your strategy's forward method with only three parameters: input, adapter, and module.

The error occurs because your `ParallelInputAdapterStrategy.forward()` expects four parameters (input, output, adapter, module), but the NeMo framework only provides three.

---

_**User**_

Ok. In that case, I should create a new class similar to `AbstractAdapterStrategy(ABC):`, one with a `forward` function with four arguments. 

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Exactly. You'll need to create your own base adapter strategy class that supports the four arguments you need. Here's how:

1. Create a new base class that extends ABC (Abstract Base Class)
2. Define the forward method with your needed signature (four parameters)
3. Create a custom implementation of the adapter mixin that uses your new strategy class

This way, you can maintain your custom logic while working around the NeMo framework's expectations. You'll need to hook into the adapter mixin's forward paths to use your custom strategy properly instead of relying on the standard `forward_enabled_adapters` method.

This is a good approach since you need functionality beyond what the standard adapter strategy interface provides.

---

_**User**_

forward_enabled_adapters is defined in adapter_mixins.AdapterModuleMixin. What does this method do? Why can't it be used? 

---

_**Assistant**_



---

`forward_enabled_adapters` in `AdapterModuleMixin` iterates through all enabled adapters and calls their forward methods one by one, chaining the output of each adapter as input to the next one. It only passes one tensor as input to each adapter strategy.

The issue is that this method assumes a standard adapter flow where:
1. Input goes into adapter
2. Adapter processes input 
3. Result is returned or combined with original input

Your implementation needs both the original input AND the base model's output to compute your adapter's result, but the standard `forward_enabled_adapters` has no way to pass both tensors to your adapter strategy.

You could modify your approach by:
1. Building a custom solution that doesn't rely on `forward_enabled_adapters`
2. Combining both tensors into a single input that your adapter can deconstruct
3. Using a wrapper adapter class that stores the base model output as state before the adapter forward call

The simplest solution might be to redesign your adapter to work with the concatenated input you've already prepared as `adapter_in`.

---

_**User**_

Yes, the simplest solution is number 2: "Combining both tensors into a single input that your adapter can deconstruct" Is that what you mean? 

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Yes, that's exactly what I mean. Looking closer at your code, you're actually already doing this approach:

```python
def forward(self, x: Float[Tensor, "batch 1"]) -> Float[Tensor, "batch 1"]:
    with torch.no_grad():
        base_out = self.base_model(x)
    adapter_in = torch.cat([x, base_out], dim=1)  # Combining into single input
    if self.is_adapter_available():
        out = self.forward_enabled_adapters(adapter_in)
    else:
        out = adapter_in
    return out
```

You're concatenating the input `x` and base model output `base_out` into a single tensor `adapter_in`, which is the right approach.

The issue is that your `ParallelInputAdapterStrategy.forward()` method still expects separate parameters for input and output, when it should be accepting this combined tensor and then splitting it internally.

You need to modify your strategy's forward method to:
1. Accept just the standard 3 parameters (input, adapter, module)
2. Extract the original input and base model output from the combined input tensor
3. Perform your operations using the extracted data

---

_**User**_

If I as you suggest, do I still need my new version of AbstractAdapterStrategy(ABC) as discussed above? 

---

_**Assistant**_



---

No, you wouldn't need a new version of AbstractAdapterStrategy. You can just use NeMo's standard AbstractAdapterStrategy class if you modify your strategy to work with the combined input.

Your modified ParallelInputAdapterStrategy would simply inherit from the standard AbstractAdapterStrategy and implement the standard forward method signature with 3 parameters. Inside that method, you would:

1. Parse the combined input tensor to extract the original input and base model output
2. Perform your adapter logic with those extracted values
3. Return the result

This approach lets you work within NeMo's existing adapter framework without having to create any custom base classes or override core functionality.

---

_**User**_

I would assume that the input and output of the base module have the same shape, cat the two inputs, and split them. 

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Yes, that's a good approach. Assuming input and output have the same shape:

1. You're already concatenating them: `adapter_in = torch.cat([x, base_out], dim=1)`
2. Inside your adapter strategy's forward method, you can split them:

```python
def forward(self, input: torch.Tensor, adapter: torch.nn.Module, *, module: "AdapterModuleMixin"):
    # Assuming input is [batch, 2*feature_dim]
    # Split it back into original input and base output
    original_feature_dim = input.shape[1] // 2
    original_input = input[:, :original_feature_dim]
    base_output = input[:, original_feature_dim:]
    
    # Now use both parts
    adapter_out = adapter(original_input)
    result = self.linear(torch.cat([base_output, adapter_out], dim=1))
    return result
```

This way, you maintain compatibility with NeMo's adapter framework while still being able to access both the original input and base model output in your adapter strategy.

---

_**User**_

In this way, I am passing a tensor rather than a tuple. 

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Exactly. You're passing a single tensor through the adapter framework instead of trying to modify the framework to accept multiple parameters or tuples. 

This approach:
1. Keeps compatibility with NeMo's adapter infrastructure
2. Still gives your strategy access to both the original input and base model output
3. Requires minimal changes to your existing code
4. Avoids having to create custom base classes

It's an elegant solution that works within the constraints of the framework while still achieving your goal of having an adapter that can consider both the input and output of the base model.

Ok, I changed the function to only have three arguments. Where is the error now?

The error is in your `adapter_cfg.yaml` file. It's trying to load `SimpleRegressionAdapter` from a package called `new_nemo_adaptive_parallel`, but:

1. The module name is incorrect - looking at your code, the class is named `SimpleRegressorAdapter` (not `SimpleRegressionAdapter`)

2. The module path is incorrect - `new_nemo_adaptive_parallel` is a file, not a package

You need to update your adapter_cfg.yaml file to use the correct target path:

```yaml
_target_: gordon.new_nemo_adaptive_parallel.SimpleRegressorAdapter
```

Or if the file is in the current directory and you're running the script from there:

```yaml
_target_: SimpleRegressorAdapter
```

The key is that the `_target_` should be the fully qualified import path to your adapter class. If you're using a custom adapter strategy, make sure its `_target_` is also correctly specified in the YAML.

_**Assistant**_

There are a few issues in your SimpleRegressorAdapter class:

1. The `size` parameter is accepted in the constructor but never saved as an attribute
2. There's a mistake in how you're calling `reset_parameters` - you're passing `self` as an argument but the method doesn't accept arguments
3. You're inheriting from SimpleRegressor but not passing any parameters to its constructor

Fix your SimpleRegressorAdapter class like this:

```python
class SimpleRegressorAdapter(SimpleRegressor, AdapterModuleUtil):
    def __init__(
        self,
        size: int,
        hidden_dim: int = 32,
        num_layers: int = 2,
        adapter_strategy: ParallelInputAdapterStrategy = None,
    ):
        # Call parent constructor with proper params
        super().__init__(hidden_dim=hidden_dim)
        
        # Save size as an instance attribute
        self.size = size
        
        # Prepare the adapter strategy
        self.setup_adapter_strategy(adapter_strategy)
        
        # Initialize the weights - no args needed
        self.reset_parameters()

    def reset_parameters(self):
        # Initialize so that the adapter outputs ones at start
        with torch.no_grad():
            self.model[0].weight = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.eye(self.size))
            self.model[-1].weight = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.eye(self.size))
```

This correctly saves the size parameter and calls reset_parameters without arguments.

_**Assistant**_

The error indicates that the model structure in your code doesn't match the saved model in "base_model.pt". The saved model has specific layer keys that don't exist in your current model definition.

This is likely because you're importing SimpleRegressor from two different places:

1. First from `gordon.pure_lightning`
2. Then later from `nemo_lightning`

These two SimpleRegressor implementations probably have different internal structures.

To fix this:
1. Make sure you're using the same SimpleRegressor class that was used to create the saved model
2. Check which import is correct and remove the other
3. Or modify the SimpleRegressor class to match the structure expected by the saved model

The specific keys missing suggest that the saved model has a sequential model with specific layers that your current implementation is missing.

---

_**User**_

Where are these two imports. I only see one. 

---

_**Assistant**_



---

You have two imports for SimpleRegressor:

1. Line 18: `from gordon.pure_lightning import SimpleRegressor`
2. Line 104: `from nemo_lightning import LossHistory, SimpleRegressor` 

The second import (inside the `if __name__ == "__main__"` block) is shadowing the first one, causing confusion about which SimpleRegressor class is being used.

Since you're trying to load a model saved with one version and using another version in your adapter, you're getting layer mismatch errors. You should:

1. Decide which SimpleRegressor implementation is correct for your model
2. Remove the duplicate import
3. Make sure your adapter class extends the same SimpleRegressor that was used to create the saved model

---

_**User**_

@new_nemo_adaptive_parallel.py Look again. 

---

_**Assistant**_



---

You're right - I apologize for the confusion. Looking again, the issue is more straightforward:

1. You import `SimpleRegressor` from `nemo_lightning` at the top level (line 18-19)
2. In your `SimpleRegressorAdapter.__init__` method, you call `super().__init__()` without any parameters
3. But the original `SimpleRegressor` constructor likely requires the `hidden_dim` parameter

The main problem is that you're not properly initializing the base `SimpleRegressor` class in your adapter.

Change your adapter's `__init__` method to:

```python
def __init__(
    self,
    size: int,
    hidden_dim: int = 32,
    num_layers: int = 2,
    adapter_strategy: ParallelInputAdapterStrategy = None,
):
    # Call SimpleRegressor's __init__ with the required parameters
    super().__init__(hidden_dim=hidden_dim)
    self.size = size
    
    # Prepare the adapter strategy
    self.setup_adapter_strategy(adapter_strategy)
    
    # Initialize the weights
    self.reset_parameters()
```

This ensures the parent class (SimpleRegressor) is properly initialized with the required parameters.

---

_**User**_

@nemo_lightning.py was saving state. Pelase save state after training in @nemo_lightning.py 

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Looking at nemo_lightning.py, I can see the model state is already properly saved after training:

```python
# Save the trained model weights for later use (e.g., for adapters)
torch.save(model.state_dict(), "base_model.pt")
print("Base model checkpoint saved as 'base_model.pt'.")
```

The issue is that your SimpleRegressorAdapter isn't properly inheriting from SimpleRegressor. You need to:

1. Pass the correct parameters to the SimpleRegressor constructor
2. Make sure you're accessing the model structure correctly

In SimpleRegressor, the model is defined as:
```python
self.net = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(1, hidden_dim),
    nn.Tanh(),
    nn.Linear(hidden_dim, 1),
)
self.model = self.net
```

So update your SimpleRegressorAdapter.__init__ to:

```python
def __init__(
    self,
    size: int,
    hidden_dim: int = 32,
    num_layers: int = 2,
    adapter_strategy: ParallelInputAdapterStrategy = None,
):
    # Initialize the parent class correctly
    super().__init__(hidden_dim=hidden_dim)
    self.size = size
    
    # Prepare the adapter strategy
    self.setup_adapter_strategy(adapter_strategy)
    
    # Initialize the weights
    self.reset_parameters()
```

_**Assistant**_



---

The error is occurring because of a tensor shape mismatch in your adapter strategy's forward method. Let's analyze what's happening:

1. Your input tensors have shape (batch_size, 1)
2. You concatenate input and output to get adapter_in with shape (batch_size, 2)
3. In the strategy forward method, you split this back into input and output
4. When passing input to adapter, it has shape (batch_size, 1)
5. Your SimpleRegressorAdapter inherited from SimpleRegressor which has a linear layer expecting input (batch_size, 1) but weights of shape (hidden_dim, 1)

The actual error is in this line in the strategy's forward method:
```python
adapter_out = torch.cat([output, adapter(input)], dim=1)
```

When `adapter(input)` is called, it's trying to use the linear layer which has a shape mismatch.

The problem is that your adapter is inheriting from SimpleRegressor, which has a fixed architecture with specific input dimensions, but you're treating it like a general adapter that processes tensors of any shape.

You need to either:
1. Create a custom adapter class that doesn't inherit from SimpleRegressor but is designed specifically for this task, or
2. Modify how you're processing the input in the strategy to match what SimpleRegressor expects

---

_**User**_

Ok, I"ll just print all the shapes out. The adaptors offtered by NEMO are extremely complex and violate the DRY principle everywehre. This makes debugging very difficult. 

---

_**Assistant**_



---

You're right - the NeMo adapter framework has many layers of abstraction which can make debugging challenging. Printing shapes is an excellent approach to understand what's happening.

Here are the key spots to add shape prints:

1. In your adapter strategy's forward method:
```python
def forward(self, in_out, adapter, *, module):
    print(f"Strategy input shape: {in_out.shape}")
    input, output = torch.split(in_out, in_out.shape[1] // 2, dim=1)
    print(f"Split input shape: {input.shape}, output shape: {output.shape}")
    
    # Call adapter and check shapes 
    adapter_output = adapter(input)
    print(f"Adapter output shape: {adapter_output.shape}")
    
    adapter_out = torch.cat([output, adapter_output], dim=1)
    print(f"Concatenated shape: {adapter_out.shape}")
    
    result = self.linear(adapter_out)
    print(f"Final result shape: {result.shape}")
    return result
```

2. In the LightningAdapterModule.forward:
```python
def forward(self, x):
    print(f"Module input shape: {x.shape}")
    with torch.no_grad():
        base_out = self.base_model(x)
    print(f"Base model output shape: {base_out.shape}")
    
    adapter_in = torch.cat([x, base_out], dim=1)
    print(f"Combined input shape: {adapter_in.shape}")
    
    if self.is_adapter_available():
        out = self.forward_enabled_adapters(adapter_in)
    else:
        out = adapter_in
    print(f"Module output shape: {out.shape}")
    return out
```

3. In SimpleRegressorAdapter.forward (if you have one):
```python
def forward(self, x):
    print(f"Adapter received shape: {x.shape}")
    result = super().forward(x)
    print(f"Adapter returning shape: {result.shape}")
    return result
```

These prints should help you trace exactly where the dimension mismatch is occurring. The key issue is likely that your SimpleRegressorAdapter is expecting input of a specific shape, but is receiving concatenated tensors with different dimensions.

---

_**User**_

Here is the output: 
```
Module input shape: torch.Size([32, 1])
Base model output shape: torch.Size([32, 1])
Combined input shape: torch.Size([32, 2])
```

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Based on the output, we can see the problem more clearly:

1. The module input is [32, 1] (batch_size=32, feature_dim=1)
2. Base model output is also [32, 1]
3. Combined input (adapter_in) is [32, 2]

The error happens when your adapter strategy tries to process these inputs. From the error message "mat1 and mat2 shapes cannot be multiplied (32x1 and 2x2)", we can see what's happening:

1. Your adapter strategy correctly splits the [32, 2] input back into two [32, 1] tensors
2. When calling `adapter(input)`, the adapter is expecting input of shape [32, 2], or has weights with shape [2, X] that don't match the [32, 1] input

The key issue is that your SimpleRegressorAdapter inherits from SimpleRegressor, which has fixed-size layers expecting an input of shape [batch_size, 1], but your adapter strategy is treating it as if it can handle tensors of various shapes.

Two solutions:

1. **Create a custom adapter that doesn't inherit from SimpleRegressor:**
   ```python
   class CustomAdapter(nn.Module, AdapterModuleUtil):
       def __init__(self, input_dim=1, hidden_dim=32, adapter_strategy=None):
           super().__init__()
           self.model = nn.Sequential(
               nn.Linear(input_dim, hidden_dim),
               nn.Tanh(),
               nn.Linear(hidden_dim, input_dim)
           )
           self.setup_adapter_strategy(adapter_strategy)
           
       def forward(self, x):
           return self.model(x)
   ```

2. **Fix the strategy to ensure the right shape is passed to the adapter:**
   ```python
   def forward(self, in_out, adapter, *, module):
       # If adapter expects [32, 1] but we have [32, 2]
       input, output = torch.split(in_out, in_out.shape[1] // 2, dim=1)
       # Make sure input to adapter is what it expects
       adapter_output = adapter(input)  # Now passes [32, 1] as expected
       # Continue with your strategy
       result = self.linear(torch.cat([output, adapter_output], dim=1))
       return result
   ```

The simplest fix would be option 2, adjusting your strategy to ensure the adapter gets the right shape.

_**User**_

`self.is_adapter_available` does not exist. "This has to do with the parent. 

---

_**Assistant**_



---

You're right. `self.is_adapter_available()` is a method that comes from `AdapterModuleMixin`, not from `SimpleRegressor`. There's confusion in your implementation.

Looking at your nemo_lightning.py code, you've added adapter-related code to the SimpleRegressor.forward method:

```python
def forward(self, x):
    print(f"Module input shape: {x.shape}")
    with torch.no_grad():
        base_out = self.net(x)
    print(f"Base model output shape: {base_out.shape}")

    adapter_in = torch.cat([x, base_out], dim=1)
    print(f"Combined input shape: {adapter_in.shape}")

    if self.is_adapter_available():  # This method doesn't exist in SimpleRegressor
        out = self.forward_enabled_adapters(adapter_in)
    else:
        out = adapter_in
    print(f"Module output shape: {out.shape}")
    return out
```

But SimpleRegressor doesn't inherit from AdapterModuleMixin, so it won't have the adapter methods.

You have a few options:

1. Make a new class for your adapter architecture:
```python
class AdaptiveRegressor(SimpleRegressor, adapter_mixins.AdapterModuleMixin):
    # Your implementation with adapter support
```

2. Fix the SimpleRegressor.forward to only do what it's supposed to:
```python
def forward(self, x):
    return self.net(x)
```

The second option is cleaner - keep SimpleRegressor simple and create a separate LightningAdapterModule that handles the adapter architecture.

---

_**User**_

Ok. The call to forward in ParallelInputAdapterStrategy has `in_out` with shape = (32,3). The second argument should be 2. Where did 3 come from?

---

_**Assistant**_



---

The extra dimension is likely coming from a double concatenation. Let me walk through what's probably happening:

1. In the `LightningAdapterModule.forward`, you do:
   ```python
   with torch.no_grad():
       base_out = self.base_model(x)  # base_model is SimpleRegressor
   adapter_in = torch.cat([x, base_out], dim=1)  # [32, 1] + [32, 1] = [32, 2]
   ```

2. But inside `self.base_model(x)` (which is SimpleRegressor), you're already doing:
   ```python
   base_out = self.net(x)
   adapter_in = torch.cat([x, base_out], dim=1)  # [32, 1] + [32, 1] = [32, 2]
   return adapter_in  # This is probably returning [32, 2] not [32, 1]
   ```

3. So in your LightningAdapterModule, you're actually doing:
   ```python
   # base_out is already [32, 2] from SimpleRegressor
   adapter_in = torch.cat([x, base_out], dim=1)  # [32, 1] + [32, 2] = [32, 3]
   ```

The issue is your SimpleRegressor has been modified to do the adapter concatenation itself, when it should just return the base model output. Fix SimpleRegressor.forward to:

```python
def forward(self, x):
    return self.net(x)  # Just return the network output
```

This way, you'll avoid the double concatenation and the shape should be correct when it reaches your adapter strategy.

I am confused regarding what is calling what. I have SimpleRegressor which is the base model in nemom_lightning. `self.is_adapter_available` is false. No adaptor is used. 
All the adapters are in new_nemo_adaptive_parallel.py. The adapter work is done in the strategy class. Correct?  
I got rid of the adapter in nemo_lightning. Now I get the error: 
```
RuntimeError: mat1 and mat2 shapes cannot be multiplied (32x1 and 2x2)
```
Diagnostics: 
```

You're right to be confused - the flow is a bit complex. Let me clarify what's happening:

1. In SimpleRegressor (nemo_lightning.py):
   - Base model takes [32, 1] input
   - Returns [32, 1] output
   - No adapter functionality here now (good)

2. In your LightningAdapterModule (new_nemo_adaptive_parallel.py):
   - Takes base_model as input
   - Concatenates input and base_model output to get [32, 2]
   - Passes this to adapter framework

3. In your ParallelInputAdapterStrategy:
   - Receives [32, 2] input
   - Splits into [32, 1] and [32, 1]
   - Calls `adapter(input)` with [32, 1]

The error is happening in this call to `adapter(input)`. Your SimpleRegressorAdapter inherits from SimpleRegressor, but SimpleRegressor has a specific model structure with linear layers expecting specific dimensions.

The key issue: When SimpleRegressorAdapter receives the [32, 1] input, it passes it to SimpleRegressor.forward which tries to run it through self.net, but the weights in your adapter model don't match what's expected.

**Solution**: Create a custom adapter that doesn't inherit from SimpleRegressor:

```python
class CustomAdapter(nn.Module, AdapterModuleUtil):
    def __init__(self, size=1, hidden_dim=32, adapter_strategy=None):
        super().__init__()
        self.model = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(size, hidden_dim),
            nn.Tanh(),
            nn.Linear(hidden_dim, size)
        )
        self.setup_adapter_strategy(adapter_strategy)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        return self.model(x)
        
    def get_default_strategy_config(self):
        return ParallelInputAdapterStrategyConfig()
```

This way you avoid the confusion with SimpleRegressor's structure.

Not quite. self.net() does work. The output is base_out with shape=(32, 1]. That is correct. 
But the net() gets called a second time. Why would that happen? I expect the flow to only need to call SimpleRegressor once. 

---

_**Assistant**_



---

You're right, and I see the issue now. The second call to self.net() is happening because:

1. SimpleRegressorAdapter inherits from SimpleRegressor
2. In ParallelInputAdapterStrategy, you call `adapter_output = adapter(input)`
3. Since adapter is a SimpleRegressorAdapter, this calls SimpleRegressorAdapter.forward
4. But SimpleRegressorAdapter doesn't override forward, so it uses SimpleRegressor.forward
5. SimpleRegressor.forward calls self.net again

That's why you see "Module input shape: torch.Size([32, 1])" twice in your debug output.

The issue is that your adapter chain looks like:
- Strategy -> SimpleRegressorAdapter -> SimpleRegressor -> self.net

Instead, your adapter should directly process the input without calling SimpleRegressor.forward again. You need to override SimpleRegressorAdapter.forward to bypass the parent's implementation:

```python
class SimpleRegressorAdapter(SimpleRegressor, AdapterModuleUtil):
    # ...existing code...
    
    def forward(self, x):
        # Don't call super().forward() which would call self.net again
        # Instead, just process x directly with whatever transformation needed
        return x  # Or some transformation of x
```

_**User**_

If I am overwriting the forward function in SimpleRegressorAdaptor, is there a need to subclass from SimpleRegressor? 

---

_**Assistant**_



---

No, there's no need to subclass SimpleRegressor if you're completely overriding its forward method and not using any of its functionality. This is actually making things more confusing.

Since you're not using SimpleRegressor's behavior, you should create a simpler, standalone adapter class:

```python
class CustomAdapter(nn.Module, AdapterModuleUtil):
    def __init__(
        self,
        size: int = 1,
        hidden_dim: int = 32,
        adapter_strategy: ParallelInputAdapterStrategy = None,
    ):
        super().__init__()
        self.size = size
        self.model = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(size, hidden_dim),
            nn.Tanh(),
            nn.Linear(hidden_dim, size)
        )
        
        # Prepare the adapter strategy
        self.setup_adapter_strategy(adapter_strategy)
        
        # Initialize weights if needed
        self.reset_parameters()
    
    def reset_parameters(self):
        with torch.no_grad():
            self.model[0].weight = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.eye(self.size))
            self.model[-1].weight = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.eye(self.size))
    
    def forward(self, x):
        return self.model(x)
        
    def get_default_strategy_config(self):
        return ParallelInputAdapterStrategyConfig()
```

This removes the unnecessary inheritance, makes the code clearer, and avoids the confusion with SimpleRegressor's methods and attributes.

Error: `RuntimeError: mat1 and mat2 shapes cannot be multiplied (32x1 and 2x2)`
the error occurs in the CustomAdapter.forward: 
```
    def forward(self, x):
        return self.model(x)
```
Where does 2x2 come from? 

---

_**Assistant**_



---

The error is happening because there's a mismatch between the `size` parameter you're setting for your adapter and the actual input dimensions.

Looking at the error "mat1 and mat2 shapes cannot be multiplied (32x1 and 2x2)":
- The input is shape (32,1) - a batch of 32 samples, each with 1 feature
- The weight matrix is shape (2,2) - this comes from using `torch.eye(self.size)` where self.size=2

The problem is in your configuration. You're setting `size=2` when creating the adapter:

```python
# Somewhere in your code or config file
adapter_cfg = {
    "_target_": "CustomAdapter",
    "size": 2,  # This should be 1 to match input dimensions
    ...
}
```

But your actual inputs are of shape (32,1). When the `nn.Linear(size, hidden_dim)` layer tries to multiply its 2x2 weights by the 32x1 input, you get the error.

To fix this, change `size=1` in your adapter configuration to match the input dimension:

```python
adapter_cfg = {
    "_target_": "CustomAdapter",
    "size": 1,  # Match input dimension
    ...
}
```

Or review your adapter_cfg.yaml file and make sure `size: 1` is set there.

Here is my output: 
```
Module input shape: torch.Size([32, 1])
Base model output shape: base_out.shape=torch.Size([32, 1])
strategy, in_out.shape=torch.Size([32, 2])
strategy, input.shape=torch.Size([32, 1]), output.shape=torch.Size([32, 1])
custom, self.size=1
custom, self.hidden_dim=32
custom, self.adapter_strategy=<new_nemo_adaptive_parallel.ParallelInputAdapterStrategy object at 0x14a31f8e0>
CustomAdapter, x.shape=torch.Size([32, 1])
```
And the error: `RuntimeError: The expanded size of the tensor (1) must match the existing size (32) at non-singleton dimension 1.  Target sizes: [32, 1].  Tensor sizes: [32]`

Now we're getting a different error! This one is about tensor dimensions not matching correctly. 

The issue is in your `reset_parameters` method where you're trying to use `torch.eye` to initialize weights:

```python
def reset_parameters(self):
    with torch.no_grad():
        self.model[0].weight = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.eye(self.size))  # PROBLEM!
        self.model[-1].weight = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.eye(self.size))  # PROBLEM!
```

`torch.eye(n)` creates an identity matrix of size [n, n]. When self.size=1, that's a [1, 1] tensor.

But your linear layer weights have different shapes:
- First layer: weight shape should be [hidden_dim, size] = [32, 1] 
- Last layer: weight shape should be [size, hidden_dim] = [1, 32]

You can fix this by removing the `reset_parameters` method entirely (letting PyTorch use default initialization) or by creating correctly sized tensors:

```python
def reset_parameters(self):
    with torch.no_grad():
        # For the first layer: Make a [hidden_dim, size] tensor
        self.model[0].weight.fill_(0.0)  # Zero it out
        # For the last layer: Make a [size, hidden_dim] tensor  
        self.model[-1].weight.fill_(0.0)  # Zero it out
```

This error shows why inheriting from SimpleRegressor and trying to manipulate its internal structure was problematic - tensor shapes don't match your expectations.

Beautiful results.

Great to see you've got excellent results! The loss curves show very rapid convergence, with both training and validation loss dropping dramatically in just the first couple of epochs.

This confirms your parallel adapter approach is working well - the adapter quickly learned to transform the base model's behavior to fit your new target function (sin(x) + x).

The parallel adapter strategy that operates on both input and output is clearly effective for this adaptation task.

_**User**_

Here are the results with hidden_dim=4. There is no convergence with hidden_dim=2. Of course, the adaptor is overkill, but this is a demonstration. I am not sure I am implementing the adaptor in the manner suggested by @NVIDIA NeMo adapter docs. In this code, I created `CustomAdapter`. Then the strategy was used to combine the Custom Adapter with the SimpleRegressor. Is this correct? The CustomAdapter parameters are not controlled via configuration files are they? 

Near the bottom of the clode, there is a class LightningAdaptorModule. I assume it is not needed for this code? 

---

_**Assistant**_

Your implementation is a valid use of adapters but with a custom twist that's not directly shown in the NeMo docs. Here's an analysis:

1. **Your adapter implementation**: You created a custom parallel adapter pattern where:
   - `CustomAdapter` processes the input
   - `ParallelInputAdapterStrategy` combines both base model output and adapter output
   
   This is a creative adaptation of the standard pattern. Most NeMo adapters modify either input or output directly, while yours creates a more complex interaction between both.

2. **Configuration control**: Yes, adapter parameters can be controlled via configuration files. Your `adapter_cfg.yaml` that you mentioned earlier would contain:
   ```yaml
   _target_: CustomAdapter
   size: 1
   hidden_dim: 4
   ```
   And the adapter is instantiated using `OmegaConf.load("adapter_cfg.yaml")`.

3. **LightningAdapterModule**: This class is essential to your implementation. It:
   - Creates the wrapper around the base model
   - Handles the concatenation of input/output
   - Manages the adapter forward pass
   - Integrates with PyTorch Lightning's training loop

Your approach where the adapter has access to both the input and output of the base model is quite interesting. Traditional adapters usually modify just the input or just the output, but your parallel approach gives more flexibility.

The hidden_dim=4 working while hidden_dim=2 not converging suggests the model needs a certain amount of capacity to properly learn the transformation from sin(x) to sin(x)+x.

Great! So what I want to do next ,not today, is 1) refactor. I think that the `LightningAdapterModule` should be in a separate file. Second: the use of YAML file is Nemo 1.0 style. But I assume the recommended approach should be more consistent with Nemo 2.0? What are the differences? 

---

_**Assistant**_



---

For refactoring:

1. Yes, moving `LightningAdapterModule` to a separate file makes sense for better code organization. You could create a file like `lightning_modules.py` that contains all your Lightning-specific modules, or even a directory structure:
   ```
   /adapters
     __init__.py
     adapter_modules.py  # CustomAdapter
     adapter_strategies.py  # ParallelInputAdapterStrategy
     lightning_modules.py  # LightningAdapterModule
   ```

2. Regarding NeMo 1.0 vs 2.0 configuration:

   NeMo 2.0 introduced several changes to configuration management:

   - More emphasis on Hydra integration for configuration
   - Better support for structured configs (Python dataclasses) over pure YAML
   - Improved type checking and validation for configurations
   - Support for more advanced configuration inheritance and composition

   For a NeMo 2.0 style approach:

   1. Define your adapter configurations as Python dataclasses with type hints:
   ```python
   @dataclass
   class CustomAdapterConfig:
       size: int = 1
       hidden_dim: int = 32
       _target_: str = "path.to.CustomAdapter"
   ```

   2. Use OmegaConf with structured configs:
   ```python
   # Create a structured config
   adapter_cfg = OmegaConf.structured(CustomAdapterConfig(hidden_dim=4))
   
   # Or merge with values from YAML
   yaml_cfg = OmegaConf.load("adapter_cfg.yaml")
   adapter_cfg = OmegaConf.merge(OmegaConf.structured(CustomAdapterConfig()), yaml_cfg)
   ```

   3. Take advantage of Hydra's configuration composition for more complex setups

   This approach gives you better type checking, IDE support, and validation while maintaining compatibility with YAML files when needed.
